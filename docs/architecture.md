# Architecture

`git-sync` is a remote-to-remote Git mirroring tool and library over smart HTTP.

## Product Rationale

The point of `git-sync` is not that Git mirroring is impossible without it. The point is that the usual alternatives are awkward at the exact layer operators often need:

- a full local mirror clone and mirror push is simple, but it turns remote-to-remote movement into a local storage and local bandwidth problem
- host-specific migration tools are useful, but they are not portable and they usually do not expose one consistent sync primitive across providers
- scripts around `git fetch` and `git push` can work, but they usually lack planning, explicit policy checks, stable machine-readable output, and a clean distinction between bootstrap and incremental sync

`git-sync` is meant to be that missing middle layer:

- provider-agnostic
- remote-to-remote
- automation-friendly
- explicit about safety and relay eligibility
- capable of handling both first-time seeding and repeat syncs

That is why the design leans so heavily on:

- relay-first strategies
- front-loaded validation
- typed results and JSON output
- explicit operation modes instead of a single opaque "mirror" operation

## When To Use `git-sync`

`git-sync` is most useful when the main problem is moving Git data between remotes without turning that into a persistent local clone service.

Strong fit:

- remote-to-remote migrations where bootstrap relay can avoid a full local mirror clone and re-push
- repeat sync jobs where updates are mostly fast-forward and the narrow incremental relay path is likely to apply
- automation environments that benefit from disposable runners and no persistent local repo storage
- provider-agnostic workflows where one explicit sync primitive is more useful than host-specific migration tooling
- operations that need clear mapping, prune, force, and relay-policy behavior with machine-readable output

Weaker fit:

- systems that need arbitrary complex Git reconciliation to succeed uniformly through one local full-state model
- services that already keep warm local mirrors and are willing to pay the storage and maintenance cost for that generality
- workflows that depend on broader history inspection, repo rewriting, or other local-object-heavy logic as a first-class feature

The practical tradeoff is:

- a local-clone service is the more general model
- `git-sync` is the lower-state, relay-first, operationally cheaper model

That means the tool gets most of its advantage when relay is common enough to be the normal case rather than an exceptional optimization.

## Core Decisions

### Relay First

The main product decision is to prefer pack relay over local decode/re-encode when that is safe:

- fetch a pack from source
- avoid materializing the full object graph locally when possible
- stream into target `receive-pack`

That is why bootstrap and incremental relay are explicit strategies instead of hidden optimizations.

### Explicit Strategy Split

The current product modes are:

- `sync`
  - planning plus reconciliation
- `replicate`
  - source-authoritative overwrite planning
  - relay-only execution
  - no materialized fallback
  - works against targets regardless of `no-thin` advertisement: the
    relayed pack is always self-contained because our upload-pack client
    does not request the `thin-pack` capability

The current transfer modes are:

- `bootstrap`
  - empty-target relay
- incremental relay
  - narrow fast path for safe updates
- materialized fallback
  The fallback remains intentionally bounded: non-relay object materialization is kept in memory and guarded by an explicit object-count limit rather than being treated as unbounded.
  - decode/repack path when relay is not safe
- batched bootstrap
  - large initial migration fallback

## Package Model

- `gitsync`
  - stable public embedding API
  - typed `Probe`, `Plan`, `Sync`, and `Replicate` requests/results
  - auth and HTTP client injection for worker-style callers
- `unstable`
  - explicitly non-stable first-party tooling surface
  - advanced controls, `Bootstrap`, `Fetch`, and CLI-oriented knobs
- `internal/gitproto`
  - smart HTTP, pkt-line, fetch/push request handling, capability negotiation
- `internal/planner`
  - desired refs, prune policy, action planning, checkpoint planning
- `internal/validation`
  - input normalization and front-loaded validation
- `internal/auth`
  - explicit token/bearer auth and git credential-helper integration
    (lookup deferred until the server returns 401)
- `internal/strategy/bootstrap`
  - one-shot relay bootstrap and batched bootstrap
- `internal/strategy/incremental`
  - narrow incremental relay path
- `internal/strategy/materialized`
  - local object materialization and encode/repack push
- `internal/syncer`
  - top-level orchestration and result shaping
- `internal/syncertest`
  - shared in-memory test fixtures

## Public API Boundary

The project now separates embedding concerns from first-party tooling concerns:

- `gitsync` is the stable library boundary.
  Callers express orchestration intent through typed probe, plan, sync, and replicate requests. Auth and transport are injected. Execution strategy remains internal.
- `unstable` is the escape hatch for advanced controls.
  It exists so the CLI and benchmark tool can use batching limits, memory measurement, verbose progress, bootstrap, and fetch without widening the stable API prematurely.

The stable result contract is also intentionally worker-oriented:

- `Refs`
  per-ref outcomes and reasons
- `Counts`
  aggregate applied/skipped/blocked/deleted counts
- `Execution`
  protocol, operation mode, transfer summary, and batch summary

That split is intentional:

- external embedders should depend on `gitsync`
- first-party tools inside this repo may use `unstable`
- strategy selection, batching heuristics, and materialized fallback controls are not yet treated as stable product contracts

## Protocol Boundaries

- Source discovery and source fetch can use protocol v2 when supported.
- Push remains on the current `receive-pack` path.
- `--protocol auto` prefers source-side v2 and falls back to v1.
- `--protocol v2` requires the source remote to negotiate v2.

Protocol v2 is used where it materially improves discovery and fetch behavior. Push stays on the existing low-level path because the tool already needs explicit command construction and streaming control there.

## Current Constraints

- smart HTTP only
- no local working tree
- explicit ref mapping, not wildcard mirroring
- objects still remain in memory for the duration of materialized paths
- batched bootstrap is intentionally narrower than normal sync

## Memory Assumptions

The relay paths and the materialized fallback have very different memory stories.

- Relay paths scale with streaming behavior.
  The source computes the pack, `git-sync` coordinates the transfer, and the target receives it directly. Large repositories are expected to stay viable primarily through bootstrap and incremental relay.
- Materialized fallback scales with the local object set that must be pushed.
  Once `git-sync` stops relaying and starts building a local push, it must hold the relevant Git objects in memory long enough to compute object closure and encode the outgoing pack.

Useful rules of thumb:

- Small branch delta fallback:
  Target already has the old branch tip, source has a few new commits, and the repo is mostly text/code.
  Memory is driven by the new commits, trees, and blobs above the target tip, not the full repo history.
  This is the most reasonable non-relay case.

- Broad fallback without shared history:
  Relay is unavailable and the target is missing most of the history or object graph behind the refs being updated.
  Memory can approach a large fraction of the pushed object set, especially if the repo contains large blobs.
  This is the risky case for the in-memory fallback.

- Ref-only delete or tiny tag case:
  Delete-only operations are effectively ref-only and do not need an object closure.
  Lightweight tag creation can also be close to ref-only when the target already has the underlying commit/tree/blob objects.
  These are cheap even without relay.

The important distinction is that "repo size" alone is not a sufficient predictor. For materialized fallback, the practical questions are:

- how many objects need to be sent
- how large the missing blobs are
- how much object overlap already exists on the target

That is why the rewrite keeps an explicit `--materialized-max-objects` guardrail. It is not a precise heap model; it is a coarse safety rail for the in-memory fallback path.
