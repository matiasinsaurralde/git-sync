# SHA1 → SHA256 Conversion

`git-sync convert-sha256` is a one-off migration command that fetches a pack
from a SHA1 HTTP source and writes a new SHA256 bare repository on disk.
Every reachable object is re-hashed under SHA256 and tree, commit, and tag
references are rewritten accordingly. The command does not push to a
remote, does not modify the source, and is meant to run once per repo.
SHA256 hashes have no relation to the original SHA1 hashes beyond a
mapping the command can optionally emit.

## Quick Start

```bash
git-sync convert-sha256 \
  https://github.com/source-org/source-repo.git \
  /path/to/out.git
```

The target directory must not exist or must be empty. The result is a bare
repository with `extensions.objectformat = sha256` and a
`refs/notes/sha1-origin` ref recording each commit's pre-conversion SHA1.

Scope is fixed: every branch and every tag on the source is always
converted. Pass `--all-refs` to also include `refs/notes/*`,
`refs/pull/*`, and other custom namespaces; pair with
`--exclude-ref-prefix` to subtract specific namespaces (e.g.
`--exclude-ref-prefix refs/pull/` on GitHub mirrors).

For a private source, pass the token via the environment so it isn't
exposed in `ps`:

```bash
GITSYNC_SOURCE_TOKEN=ghp_xxx git-sync convert-sha256 \
  https://github.com/source-org/private-repo.git \
  /path/to/out.git
```

## What It Does

1. Probes the source via smart HTTP and lists every in-scope ref.
2. Fetches a single self-contained pack via `upload-pack` into a
   temporary on-disk SHA1 bare repo (cleaned up at the end unless
   `--keep-source-objects` is passed).
3. Discovers every reachable object — walking trees, commits, and tags
   — and records each one's SHA1 and object type. Submodule gitlinks
   are checked here; unresolvable ones fail-fast before any output is
   written.
4. Initializes the target as a bare SHA256 repository
   (`git init --object-format=sha256` equivalent).
5. Translates every reachable object in topological order via memoized
   DFS:
   - **Blobs**: re-hashed under SHA256; content unchanged.
   - **Trees**: each entry's hash translated.
   - **Commits**: `tree` and `parent` hashes translated; GPG signatures
     and `mergetag` headers dropped; in-scope SHA1 references in the
     message are translated first and then substituted.
   - **Tags**: target hash translated; signatures dropped; message
     hashes rewritten the same way.
6. Writes refs at the translated tip hashes; repoints HEAD to the
   source's symbolic HEAD; builds `refs/notes/sha1-origin` (unless
   `--no-origin-notes`); emits the `--write-mapping` TSV (if requested).

## Side Outputs

The conversion deliberately decouples SHA1 from SHA256 — two runs of
this tool against the same source produce SHA256 hashes that share
nothing with the originals. Three on-ramps help bridge the gap.

### Inline message rewriting (default on)

Commit and tag messages are scanned for 7-to-40-character hex runs.
When a run uniquely matches a commit or tag SHA1 in the reachable set,
it is replaced with the full SHA256 hex:

```
Reverts: a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0    →    full SHA256
Cherry-picked from a1b2c3d                            →    full SHA256
```

Two properties make this robust:

- **Uniqueness is decided against the reachable set, not the in-flight
  mapping.** The discovery pass enumerates every reachable SHA1 before
  any encoding starts, so abbreviated prefixes get the same verdict
  regardless of how far the translation has progressed. Ambiguous
  prefixes are left unrewritten and reported (warning on stderr +
  `--json`'s `ambiguousMessageRefs`); look them up in the mapping file.
- **Cross-branch references resolve.** Each in-scope SHA1 mentioned in
  a message is added as a dependency edge in the translation DFS, so
  the referenced commit is translated before the referencing commit is
  encoded. A cherry-pick from a sibling branch resolves just as
  reliably as a revert of an ancestor.

False positives are essentially impossible: a run is substituted only
if its prefix uniquely matches a commit or tag in scope. Blob and tree
hashes are excluded from the match set. Disable with
`--no-rewrite-messages` if you prefer untouched messages.

### Origin notes ref (default on)

`refs/notes/sha1-origin` holds, for each translated commit, the
pre-conversion SHA1 keyed by the new SHA256:

```bash
git -C /path/to/out.git notes --ref=sha1-origin show <sha256>
# prints the original SHA1

git -C /path/to/out.git log --notes=sha1-origin
# shows the original SHA1 below each commit's body
```

Notes attach meaningfully only to commits; blobs, trees, and tags are
not represented. Disable with `--no-origin-notes`.

### Sidecar mapping file (opt in via `--write-mapping`)

`--write-mapping <path>` emits a TSV with one line per translated
object, sorted by SHA1:

```
# sha1   sha256
00027b675386b21c4ca05316145671fb7034d251   d80415fa21bebb...
000bb155604d06f1c48fc7feb4b025d991ef3366   a23cf98db5abfa...
...
```

Useful for bulk rewriting external systems: feed the file to a script
that walks Jira tickets, PR bodies, deploy manifests, or any other
system that holds frozen SHA1 references.

## Flags

--verbose, -v                      verbose logging
```

There are no `--branch`, `--tags`, or `--map` flags: scope is fixed to
every branch and every tag on the source.

Environment fallbacks: `GITSYNC_SOURCE_TOKEN`, `GITSYNC_SOURCE_USERNAME`,
`GITSYNC_SOURCE_BEARER_TOKEN`, `GITSYNC_SOURCE_INSECURE_SKIP_TLS_VERIFY`,
`GITSYNC_SOURCE_FOLLOW_INFO_REFS_REDIRECT`, `GITSYNC_PROTOCOL`.

## Sharp Edges

**GPG signatures are stripped.** A signature is bytes signed over the
commit's pre-conversion content (including the SHA1 hashes in `tree`
and `parent` lines). After rewriting, the bytes no longer match the
signature, so verification would always fail; the command drops them
and prints a count. Signed annotated tags lose their signature the
same way. `mergetag` headers on merge commits — which embed a signed
tag with its own signature — are removed entirely, since the embedded
tag references original SHA1s and the signature was computed over
those original bytes.

**Submodule gitlinks must resolve in-repo.** Tree entries with mode
`160000` reference a commit in another repository, but a SHA1 hash
cannot be embedded in a SHA256 tree. The command fails-fast in the
discovery pass — before the target bare repo is initialized — naming
the offending tree, entry, and hash. Convert the submodule repository
first so its commit hashes are available in SHA256.

**Replace refs and source notes refs become detached.**
`refs/replace/<sha1>` encodes a SHA1 in the ref name, so the name
doesn't match under SHA256 and the replacement never triggers.
`refs/notes/*` trees from the source (copied under `--all-refs`)
encode the target object's hash as the entry name, so notes survive
as data but no longer attach to their original commits. Use the
tool's own `refs/notes/sha1-origin` for the inverse lookup.

## Operational Notes

**One-off, not incremental.** Each run produces a fresh SHA256 repo
from scratch — there is no "fetch the new SHA1 commits and append to
the existing SHA256 repo" mode. Realistic use: convert once, then
make the converted repo the new canonical store. Branch and tag
hashes are deterministic across runs against the same source state;
only `refs/notes/sha1-origin` differs because its wrapper commit
carries `time.Now()` as the committer timestamp.

**Loose-object storage.** Every translated object is written as a
loose file under `objects/<aa>/<rest>` — no pack file is produced.
Correct, but slow on filesystems that dislike millions of small files.
Run `git -C <target> gc --aggressive` afterwards to pack the converted
repo down to a single packfile.

**Memory linear in reachable object count.** Two `map[Hash]…`
structures stay live for the whole run: `reachable` (SHA1 → object
type, built by discovery) and `mapping` (SHA1 → SHA256, built by
translation). At cobra scale (~5k objects), kilobytes; at Linux kernel
scale (~16M objects), roughly 2 GB peak.

**Discovery adds a ~1.5× decode pass.** Every reachable object is
decoded twice: once in discovery (no encoding) and once in translation
(decode + encode). The cost buys consistent uniqueness verdicts for
message rewriting and submodule fail-fast.

**Abbreviated-prefix lookup is a linear scan.** Each abbreviated SHA1
in a message triggers an O(reachable) scan to check uniqueness. Fine
to ~100k commits; slower past that. A sorted-prefix index would make
it O(log N), an easy optimization if someone hits the wall.

## Verifying the Output

Standard git tooling works against the converted repo without
additional flags — the `extensions.objectformat` setting in the local
config is enough for git to switch hashing:

```bash
git -C /path/to/out.git fsck --full                     # zero errors expected
git -C /path/to/out.git config extensions.objectformat  # prints sha256
git -C /path/to/out.git log --oneline -5                # SHA256 hashes
git -C /path/to/out.git log --notes=sha1-origin -5      # with original SHA1
```

To use the result as a working repo:

```bash
git clone /path/to/out.git /path/to/checkout
```

To serve it from a host that accepts SHA256:

```bash
git -C /path/to/out.git push --mirror <new-remote-url>
```

## Implementation Notes

The pipeline runs in four phases (pack fetch → discovery → target init →
translation), with refs and side outputs written at the end. Submodule
errors surface in discovery, before the target repo is materialized.

Translation is a memoized recursive DFS. Tree, parent, tag-target, and
message-reference edges are all part of the DFS, so the mapping is
populated by the time any object's bytes are encoded. A defensive
`inProgress` set guards against cycles; real Git histories can't form
them (parent/tree/tag-target edges are a DAG, and SHA1 message-
reference cycles are cryptographically infeasible), but a trip into
the guard becomes a hard error rather than a stack overflow.

Loose object writing is done by hand rather than via go-git's
`SetEncodedObject`. The underlying `plumbing/format/objfile.Writer`
in `go-git/v6@v6.0.0-alpha.3` hardcodes SHA1 in its hasher, which
would put every translated object at a SHA1-derived path even though
the content references SHA256. A unit test recomputes `sha256` of
every loose object's decompressed content and compares against the
filename to prevent regression.
